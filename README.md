When we look at Human vs AI, we are looking at two different learning styles. Humans solve problems by using prior experiences and intuition. They also utilize heuristic strategies like always moving forward or following a specific wall (Right or Left). They will also try to avoid previously bad areas. Then lastly humans will spatially scan the grid and recognize patterns of a relationship that will dictate movement. Machines on the other hand are entirely driven by data. They utilize a computational method of reinforcement learning. Within this learning experience the program will be awarded with positive outcomes. 
For this project I created the Q-Train Algorithm. The replay memory logic, training loop, and reward handling was all done by me. This allowed me to customize my Q-Learning algorithm to encourage optimal navigation throughout the game. I tried to balance the need of exploration with exploitation. When looking at a problem as a computer scientist, I want to understand the objective. I then take the problem and break it down into smaller peices.
